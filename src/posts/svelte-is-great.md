# Svelte is great!

There are several things which I really like about *Svelte*. Let me list some of them:

- It's **easy to learn**. 
- It makes **fun** to write Svelte!
- There is almost **no boilerplate** code, in particular when compared to other frameworks.
- It is very simple to make your app **reactive**.
- The **[docs](https://svelte.dev/docs)** are very clear, easy to follow. 
- It's very close to **Vanilla JS**.
    - This also means that we can often use classical JS features.
    - There is no need to reinvent the wheel!
- Since Svelte compiles your components to Vanilla JS at build time, the client doesn't need to load any framework code, which makes your app very **fast**.
- Styles are **scoped** by default (but can be easily made global if needed).
- Both **animations** and **state management** are built into Svelte.
    - No need to install other libraries for that!
- I like the **community** of Svelte developers.
