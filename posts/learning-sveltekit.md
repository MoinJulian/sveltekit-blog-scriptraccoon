# Learning SvelteKit

While I had a great experience and immediate sense of achievement while learning Svelte, its meta framework SvelteKit is much harder.

It seems that the [docs](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) assume a certain familiarity with a bit more advanced concepts of web development. So as a beginner (like myself), you can easily get lost there. Oftentimes I found myself researching stuff at other resources before I could understand what the docs are talking about.

SvelteKit has a lot of features, in fact learning it makes Svelte look like a little toy for kids (in comparison), and I am still in the process of learning the basics. Probably the best advice is just to build projects.

> Learning by doing!

I like the fact that the deployment to Netlify is so easy. Just add a site on Netlify, connect it to your GitHub repository, click deploy, and done! Netlify automatically recognizes that it's SvelteKit. Although the Netlify docs say that you need their adapter to be added to your SvelteKit project, in my understanding this is already integrated into the preinstalled `adapter-auto`. So there is no need to change the `svelte.config.js` file.
